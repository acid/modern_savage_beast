=== Modern Savage Beast ===

Modern Savage Beast is a revision of the old Savage Beast Plugin.
Most of the work where done in the views (haml) and the text-system 
(bye gettext/gibberish, hello I18n api!).
Savage Beast is a Rails Message forum plugin based on the popular Beast plugin.
The Savage Beast plugin has been installed in hundreds of Rails sites, partially
because it's the only viable choice for a message forum plugin, but also because
it incorporates a lot of features that would be a time-consuming headache for you
to implement yourself.

This version of ModernSavage Beast has been tested working in Rails 2.3.

=== Installation ===

git submodule add git://github.com/acid/modern_savage_beast.git vendor/plugins/modern_savage_beast
git submodule update --init

> rake savage_beast:bootstrap_db
> rake savage_beast:bootstrap_assets
> rake savage_beast:add_gems
> rake savage_beast:add_includes #assumes that your User-Model is called user.rb

You could install all missing gems with

> rake gems:install

You will also need a bunch of other plugins to use MSB:
will_paginate
white_list
white_list_formatted_content
acts_as_list
acts_as_taggable_on

Implement in your User-Model:

display_name
admin?
currently_online

In your Application-Controller you will need:

current_user
login_required
admin?
logged_in?
authorized?

After you've done that, your forum should be up and ready, you could reach it over server.tld/forums.
Feel free to overwrite parts of the Forum for your own needs in the application. All of modern_savage_beast's controllers and views are in the Forums-Namespace.

Feel also free to contribute or ask me some questions. More Information is definitely to come in the Future! :)
