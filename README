=== Savage Beast ===

Savage Beast is a Rails Message forum plugin based on the popular Beast plugin.
The Savage Beast plugin has been installed in hundreds of Rails sites, partially
because it's the only viable choice for a message forum plugin, but also because
it incorporates a lot of features that would be a time-consuming headache for you
to implement yourself.

This version of Savage Beast has been tested working in Rails 2.3 without
the Engines plugin, and in Rails 2.0-2.2 with use of the Engines plugin.

See http://www.williambharding.com/blog/?p=100 for install instructions
See http://code.google.com/p/savage-beast-2/ to grab the latest version

Please post any comments or suggestions to the blog post.  If you would like
to make a contribution to improve this plugin, send me an email via the site.

If you're rolling Rails 2.2 or earlier, be sure you carefully follow the
Engines installation instructions!  That
line to add to your environment file is easily missed.
